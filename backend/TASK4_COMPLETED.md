# Task 4 Completion: Metadata Extraction Worker

## Completed Components

1. **Created the Metadata Extraction Worker**
   - Implemented `metadata_extraction_worker.py` with comprehensive metadata extraction capabilities
   - Extracts video properties like resolution, frame rate, duration, file size, and format
   - Generates color profiles and histograms
   - Uses ffprobe integration for advanced metadata when available
   - Saves metadata to JSON files

2. **Updated Main FastAPI Application**
   - Modified `handle_status_message` function to process metadata extraction status updates
   - Added proper state management for metadata extraction tasks

3. **Enhanced Worker Runner**
   - Updated `run_worker.py` to support both worker types via command-line arguments
   - Added ability to run either the video enhancement or metadata extraction worker

4. **Added Testing**
   - Created `test_metadata_extraction_worker.py` for testing the worker functionality
   - Implemented unit tests for worker creation and metadata extraction

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Modified README.md to include metadata extraction worker instructions
   - Updated project structure documentation

6. **Created Startup Script**
   - Added `start_services.sh` to simplify running all components together
   - Includes proper signal handling and cleanup

## Integration Details

The metadata extraction worker integrates with the existing system by:

1. Connecting to the same RabbitMQ task exchange as the video enhancement worker
2. Using a separate queue name to ensure both workers receive all tasks
3. Publishing status updates to the same status exchange used by other components
4. Following the same processing state model to maintain consistency

## Metadata Features

The worker extracts the following metadata:

- Basic properties: resolution, frame rate, duration, format
- Advanced metadata via ffprobe: codec information, bitrate, etc.
- Color profile: color histograms, average color values
- File information: size, name, format

## How to Run

1. Start all services together:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./start_services.sh
   ```

2. Or run each component separately:
   ```bash
   # Start FastAPI server
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   
   # Start Video Enhancement Worker
   python run_worker.py --worker video-enhancement
   
   # Start Metadata Extraction Worker
   python run_worker.py --worker metadata-extraction
   ```

## Next Steps

- Expand metadata extraction to include scene detection
- Add more advanced video analysis features
- Implement a database for persistent storage of metadata
